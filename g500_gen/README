Based on graph500 generator.
It always generates a directed graph in edge list format. 
If you want an undirected graph, we need to use a converter to generate the reverse edge. 
Generally, the converter (other projects) will convert the edge file to directed and undirected CSR or other formats.

Only MPI version is tested, and default "make" will compile the MPI version. Hence, you can use any cluster with MPI to generate graphs.
However, this compiled binary can be used in a single machine as well. 

See macro in the user_settings.h for generating the graph to configure the edge size. There are 3 options, where you can configure the 
size of each edge. Vertex ends of each edge can either be 32bit, 48bit or 64bit size. 

This executable can be used to generate any size graph, as the generator writes the graph file periodically to disk so that the memory
requirement remains below a threshold.

Use the executable without any command line to print the help message.
